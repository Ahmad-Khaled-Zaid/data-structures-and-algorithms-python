# Singly Linked List

singly linked list is a linear data structure in which each element is connected to only one other element.

## Challenge

Use OOP to create a Singly Linked List class, and this List have the following methods:  
1-`add_first`: add a node to the beginning of the list  
2-`include`: check if a value is included in the list  
3-`to_string`: return a string representation of the list

## Approach & Efficiency

Create Two classed, one for the node and one for the list.  
the node class will have the following properties:  
1-`value`: the value of the node  
2-`next`: the next node in the list

* The list class will have the following properties:  
  1-`head`: the first node in the list  
  2-`current node`: the current node in the list  
  3- `text varibale`:a string representation of the list
