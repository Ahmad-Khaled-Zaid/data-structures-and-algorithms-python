## Approach & Efficiency

according to requitemts, it's not allowed to use any built-in methods.
so we need to use a loop to reverse the array.
I used while loop to reverse the array.
Time complexity is O(n)
How many statements are executed, relative to input size n? Often,
but NOT always, we can get an idea from the number of times a loop
iterates.
