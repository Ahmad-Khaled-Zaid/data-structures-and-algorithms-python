# Hash tables
Hash Table is a Data structure that will store data in key and value pairs using buckets using 5 main methods
set,get,hash,key to provide better efficiency

## Challenge

Implement a Hashtable Class with the following methods:

### **set** 
Arguments: key, value  
Returns: nothing  
This method should hash the key, and set the key and value pair in the table, handling collisions as needed.  
Should a given key already exist, replace its value from the value argument given to this method.  
### **get**  
Arguments: key  
Returns: Value associated with that key in the table  
### **contains**  
Arguments: key  
Returns: Boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.  
### **keys**  
Returns: Collection of keys  
### **hash**  
Arguments: key  
Returns: Index in the collection for that key
